# Simple Calculator - Python

This is a simple calculator project created using Python as part of my CodSoft Internship.

In this project, I have used Python functions to perform basic arithmetic operations such as:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

The program runs inside a loop so the user can perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit.

I have also handled division by zero to avoid errors.

This project helped me understand:
- Functions in Python
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- User input handling
- Basic error handling

Thank you for checking my project 🙂
